\datedsubsection{\textbf{Security implications on CHERI semantics of LLVM optimization passes}}{11/2022 - Ongoing}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Define CHERI C semantics and identify the CHERI-related invariants/properties.
  \item Provide a thorough analysis and testing of LLVM optimization passes in the current CHERI LLVM fork, focusing on functional and security semantics preservation. In case CHERI security guarantees are violated, propose a proof of concept and workarounds if it is feasible. 
  \item Propose and test new optimization passes and/or modify existing optimization passes which exploit CHERI invariants to improve performance.
